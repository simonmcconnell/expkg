## What's all this about then?

 Thought it would be easier to create a binary executable using Zig in a Mix Release step than to figure out how to handle all the different ways to pass around and escape arguments in batch scripts, command prompt, powershell and powershell core.  I wanted to make it simple for the end user of software that is installed by them on their own, typically Windows, infrastructure.  

## What is the difference?

TLDR: 

- if you want a single binary, use `burrito`
- if you want to add CLI commands to a Mix Release, consider using `expkg`
- if end users are installing your software, consider using `expkg`
- if you're deploying to your own infrastructure, use whatever you like

## About
<!-- MDOC !-->

Generate an Elixir [release](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Release.html) with a **binary executable** launcher, instead of batch/shell scripts.

`Expkg` uses [Burrito](https://github.com/burrito-elixir/burrito) with a modified build phase.
